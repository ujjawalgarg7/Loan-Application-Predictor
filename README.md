# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

LOANS are the major requirement of the modern world. By this only, Banks get a major part of the total profit. It is beneficial for students to manage their education and living expenses, and for people to buy any kind of luxury like houses, cars, etc.

But when it comes to deciding whether the applicant’s profile is relevant to be granted with loan or not. Banks have to look after many aspects.

So, here we will be using Machine Learning with Python to ease their work and predict whether the candidate’s profile is relevant or not using key features like Marital Status, Education, Applicant Income, Credit History, etc.

## Conclusion : 

Random Forest Classifier is giving the best accuracy with an accuracy score of 82% for the testing dataset. And to get much better results ensemble learning techniques like Bagging and Boosting can also be used.
